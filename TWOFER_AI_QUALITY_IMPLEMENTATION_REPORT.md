# Twofer AI Quality Implementation Report

## PR 1 - Provider foundation, cost, and resilience

Status: Partially implemented locally on branch `codex/ai-quality-pr1-provider-foundation`.

Safety checkpoint: `c6210777`.

Deployment actions: none.

Supabase migrations applied: none. Migration file added only; applying it is hard-gated for Dan approval.

Live secret names changed: none.

## What landed

- `OPENAI_MODEL` now defaults to `gpt-5.5`.
- Unsupported OpenAI text models throw `AI_TEXT_CONFIG_INVALID` instead of silently falling back to `gpt-4o-mini`.
- GPT-5 family chat tuning now defaults to `reasoning_effort: "medium"` unless a caller explicitly overrides it.
- Added a provider-neutral structured text router for OpenAI and Gemini.
- Wired the `ai-generate-ad-variants` copy stage through the text router.
- Added Gemini text fallback for OpenAI quota, credit, billing, model availability, authentication, timeout, transient, and circuit-open classes when feature flags enable fallback.
- Preserved existing deterministic fallback behavior and existing copy validation/repair behavior.
- Added private provider-attempt telemetry in the ad generation payload and private cost-ledger rows.
- Added configurable cost-budget projection helpers.
- Added persistent circuit-breaker helper and a service-role-only migration.

## Feature flags

- `AI_V3_PROVIDER_ROUTER_ENABLED`
- `AI_V3_COST_BUDGET_ENABLED`
- `AI_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_ENABLED`
- Existing plan flags still pending in later slices:
  - `AI_V3_CREATIVE_PROFILE_ENABLED`
  - `AI_V3_FIVE_CANDIDATES_ENABLED`
  - `AI_V3_INDEPENDENT_JUDGE_ENABLED`
  - `AI_V3_MERCHANT_IMAGE_CONTROL_ENABLED`
  - `AI_V3_CUSTOM_IMAGE_EDIT_ENABLED`
  - `AI_V3_IMAGE_QA_ENABLED`
  - `AI_V3_IMAGE_QA_FAIL_CLOSED`
  - `AI_V3_IMAGE_SAFE_ZONE_ENABLED`

## Provider routing behavior

Primary text provider: OpenAI.

Primary model: `gpt-5.5`.

Fallback text provider: Gemini, model `gemini-3.5-flash`, when `AI_V3_PROVIDER_ROUTER_ENABLED=true` and `AI_TEXT_FALLBACK_ENABLED=true`.

Gemini judge model: resolver support is not fully wired to judging yet; judging belongs to PR 2.

Image provider routing: not changed in PR 1.

## Failover classes

Immediate fallback classes:

- `quota_exhausted`
- `insufficient_credits`
- `spend_limit_reached`
- `billing_hard_limit`
- `model_unavailable`
- `model_not_found`
- `authentication`
- `configuration`
- `circuit_open`
- `timeout`

Retry once, then fallback:

- `transient_rate_limit`
- `server_error`
- `network`

Provider output invalid:

- Preserved existing copy validator behavior by returning no variants so the existing corrective retry/fallback path runs.

## Cost and timeout controls

- Primary text timeout default: `AI_TEXT_PRIMARY_TIMEOUT_MS` or 12000 ms.
- Fallback text timeout default: `AI_TEXT_FALLBACK_TIMEOUT_MS` or 14000 ms.
- Full timeout does not retry OpenAI when `AI_RETRY_AFTER_FULL_TIMEOUT=false`; it falls back if fallback is enabled.
- Optional fallback can be blocked by hard budget projection when `AI_V3_COST_BUDGET_ENABLED=true`.
- Estimated cost is logged per provider attempt where available.

## Prompt versions

- Existing `AD_COPY_PROMPT_VERSION` remains `AI_COPY_PROMPT_V3`.
- PR 1 does not implement the PR 2 creative brief/five-lane prompt replacement.

## Tests added and results

Focused test run:

```text
npx vitest run supabase/functions/_shared/openai-chat-model.test.ts supabase/functions/_shared/ai-text-provider.test.ts supabase/functions/_shared/ai-provider-circuit-breaker.test.ts supabase/functions/_shared/ai-cost-budget.test.ts supabase/functions/_shared/ai-costs.test.ts
```

Result: 5 files passed, 25 tests passed.

Targeted Deno checks:

```text
deno check supabase/functions/_shared/ai-text-provider.ts
deno check supabase/functions/_shared/openai-text-provider.ts
deno check supabase/functions/_shared/gemini-text-provider.ts
deno check supabase/functions/_shared/ai-provider-circuit-breaker.ts
deno check supabase/functions/ai-generate-ad-variants/index.ts
```

Result: all passed.

Full validation:

```text
npm run typecheck
npm run typecheck:functions
npm run test
npm run lint
npm run copy:evaluate
npx expo export --platform android --output-dir "%TEMP%\twofer-metro-probe-codex-ai-pr1" --clear
```

Results:

- `npm run typecheck`: passed.
- `npm run typecheck:functions`: passed, 119 Edge Function files checked.
- `npm run test`: passed, 118 test files and 680 tests.
- `npm run lint`: passed.
- `npm run copy:evaluate`: passed, 30 fixtures valid, 0 invalid, no changed facts.
- Metro bundle probe: passed, Android bundle exported to a temp folder. Existing `country-flag-icons` package export warnings appeared but did not fail the bundle.

## Acceptance criteria map

1. Live primary creative model resolves to `gpt-5.5`: Implemented.
2. Unsupported model names do not silently downgrade: Implemented.
3. Gemini 3.5 Flash configured as OpenAI availability/credit fallback: Implemented for ad-variant copy path behind flags.
4. OpenAI credit/quota failure falls back immediately: Implemented for routed copy path.
5. Full timeout does not cause a second full OpenAI wait: Implemented for routed copy path.
6. Persistent circuit breaker works across Edge Function instances: Partially implemented; migration/helper added, not applied or live-tested.
7. Per-stage provider/model/latency/token/cache/cost telemetry is stored: Partially implemented for routed copy attempts; cache fields depend on provider usage.
8. Configurable cost ceilings limit optional calls: Partially implemented for routed fallback projection.
9. Merchant receives preview or deterministic fallback, never blank: Preserved for copy path.
10-19. Creative quality ceiling criteria: Not implemented; PR 2.
20. Existing style-gate logic active in production path: Preserved, not newly expanded.
21. BOGO/2-for-1 shorthand blocked: Preserved by existing validators.
22. Immutable offer facts remain unchanged: Preserved.
23. Revisions pass same validation and judgment path: Partially implemented for routed copy revisions; independent judging pending.
24. Category playbooks active: Not implemented; PR 4.
25. Deterministic fallback usage and reason logged: Preserved and expanded with provider attempts.
26. Approval tied to exact final version: Preserved, not changed in PR 1.
27-46. Merchant image control and image quality criteria: Not implemented; PR 3.
47. Exact offer lines and terms from structured fields: Preserved.
48. Consumer feed/detail share authoritative helpers: Not implemented; PR 4.
49. Legacy canned output cannot appear as live AI: Not implemented in PR 1.
50. Google data flow documented before activation: Not implemented; activation should remain gated.
51. No generation/publish path bypasses router, offer contract, image selection, approval controls: Partially implemented; ad-variant copy path routed, other active text routes still direct.
52. No GPT-5.4-mini versus GPT-5.5 comparison performed: Implemented.

## Unresolved risks

- `ai-generate-deal-copy`, `ai-create-deal`, `ai-deal-suggestions`, `ai-compose-offer`, `ai-translate-deal`, and `ai-extract-menu` still call OpenAI directly.
- Image QA still uses OpenAI directly.
- Missing `OPENAI_API_KEY` still hard-stops `ai-generate-ad-variants` because research and image QA still depend on OpenAI in PR 1.
- The circuit breaker migration is written but not applied.
- Provider pricing values for future model IDs should be verified before production enablement.
- Privacy/subprocessor documentation must be updated before enabling Google text fallback in production.

## Rollback

Set these hosted flags/secrets without reverting schema:

```text
AI_V3_PROVIDER_ROUTER_ENABLED=false
AI_TEXT_FALLBACK_ENABLED=false
AI_V3_COST_BUDGET_ENABLED=false
AI_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_ENABLED=false
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-5.4-mini
```

Do not roll back immutable offer validation, deterministic fallback copy, or exact-version merchant approval.
